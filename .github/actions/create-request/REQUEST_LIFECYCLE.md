# PR-Centric Request Architecture

This document defines the PR-centric management model used in this repository.

The purpose of this document is not to explain implementation details, but to define the management architecture so that AI systems with GitHub interfaces can immediately understand:

- This project uses a PR-centric request model.
- How requests are initialized.
- How structure is enforced automatically.
- How to adopt this model in another repository.

---

## 1. Core Principle

**PR = Request**

This repository does not use:

- Milestones
- Start/Completion Issues
- Lifecycle ceremony

A draft Pull Request represents:

- Management intent (Background)
- Intended implementation strategy (Approach)

The PR is the single management unit.

---

## 2. Initialization Mechanism

Requests are initialized via a GitHub Action:

`.github/actions/create-request`

and the workflow:

`.github/workflows/initialize-request.yml`

When triggered, the Action:

1. Creates a new branch from the default branch.
2. Adds a `.create-request` marker file containing the branch name.
3. Opens a structured Draft Pull Request.

The marker file ensures that a commit difference exists so that the PR can be created immediately.

---

## 3. Structured PR Format

The Draft PR body is generated by the Action with the following structure:

```markdown
## Background

// management context

## Approach

// implementation strategy
```

Guidelines:

- Inputs support Markdown.
- Use only `###` or smaller headings inside sections.
- Do not redefine ``## Background` or `## Approach` at the top level.

This structure is intented for management-level AI.

The implementation AI only needs to fulfill the PR.

---

## 4. Completion Model

A request is considered complete when:

- The implementation is reviewed.
- The PR is merged (squash merge recommended).

#here are no additional closing artifacts.

---

## 5. Adoption in Another Repository

An AI with GitHub interface can adopt this model by:

1. Copying ``.github/actions/create-request`
. Directory
2. Copying ``.github/workflows/initialize-request.yml`
file
3. Enabling pull-requests: write permissions for GitHub Actions.

Upon copy, the repository automatically supports:

- Structured request initialization
- PR-based management
- AI-aligned operation
